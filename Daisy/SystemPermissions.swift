//
//  SystemPermissions.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Single observable façade over the four macOS privacy permissions
//  Daisy interacts with: Microphone, Calendar, Accessibility, Screen
//  Recording. Used by the Connections → Permissions tab so users can
//  see what's granted, request what isn't, and open System Settings
//  for what was previously denied.
//
//  ─── Why centralise this ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  Each permission has its own API surface — `AVCaptureDevice` for
//  mic, `EKEventStore` for Calendar, `AXIsProcessTrusted` for
//  Accessibility, `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess` for Screen
//  Recording — and the UI on every screen that cares about them used
//  to call them ad-hoc. This service:
//    • polls all four on construction and on app focus, so the UI
//      reflects external changes (user toggling in System Settings);
//    • exposes a unified `Status` enum so the view layer can switch
//      uniformly without converting AVAuthorizationStatus vs
//      EKAuthorizationStatus vs raw Bool;
//    • provides `request…()` and `openSettings…()` per service so
//      the row UI is just "iconName + title + status + button".
//
//  ─── Hardened Runtime gotcha (debugged 2026-05-20) ────────────────
//
//  Calendar prompt was silently rejected by tccd for hours until we
//  realised macOS Hardened Runtime requires
//  `com.apple.security.personal-information.calendars` in entitlements
//  even when App Sandbox is OFF. Same is true of `.addressbook`,
//  `.photos-library`, `.reminders`, `.location`. Mic / Accessibility /
//  Screen Recording do NOT require entitlements under non-sandboxed
//  Hardened Runtime — only Info.plist usage strings. See
//  `Daisy/Daisy.entitlements` for the canonical comment.
